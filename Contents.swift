 # Welcome to EarthQuackeðŸ¦†!
 the simulation of earthquake
 
 I'm going to present to simulate each number on the Ritcher scale in an earthquake, the purpose of this simulates is I want people to appreciate how big earthquake is, what does those Scale Ritcher mean in news? why does 7 Ritcher seem to have a really big deal but 6 isn't?  you don't know,  neither I'm!
 
 So, to know how big differences I create this turns out it's really Ritcher scale is 10x scale!  that's why the 5 Ritcher scale is not much compared to the 7 Ritcher scale! that's 100x bigger!
 
 Hopefully, this will help people to appreciate how big the earthquake is, if other parts of the earth experienced a big disaster, we do not only know the numbers but we now know what actually is
